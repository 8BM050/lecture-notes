   abstract = {Systems biology is a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the manner in which all the components of a biological system interact functionally over time. Such an analysis is executed by an interdisciplinary team of investigators that is also capable of developing required technologies and computational tools. In this model, biology dictates what new technology and computational tools should be developed, and, once developed, these tools open new frontiers in biology for exploration. Thus, biology drives technology and computation, and, in turn, technology and computation revolutionize biology. Systems approaches have long been taken, particularly in immunology, physiology, development, and neu-robiology. However, technology development during the 1980s permitted the concepts generated by many years of reductionist inquiry to be analyzed in the context of the entire system. Automated DNA sequencers enabled the sequencing of genomes and the definition of polymorphisms among individuals; microarray analysis permitted global transcriptional profiling, and advances in mass spectrometry led to large-scale proteo-mic and metabolomic analysis. The mountains of data generated by these high-throughput platforms led to the rapid growth of computational biology and bioinfor-matics. Thus, knowledge of the complete sequences of genomes, together with technology that permit the monitoring of information flow leading to specific cellular functions, set the stage for systems biology. There are three basic concepts that are crucial to understanding complex biological systems: they are emergence, robustness, and modularity. Emergence. Complex systems display properties, often called "emergent properties," that are not demonstrated by their individual parts and cannot be predicted even with full understanding of the parts alone. For example, understanding the properties of hydrogen and oxygen does not allow us to predict the properties of water. Life is an example of an emergent property. It is not inherent in DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids but is a consequence of their actions and interactions. A comprehensive understanding of such emergent properties requires systems-level perspectives and cannot be gleaned from simple reductionist approaches. Robustness. Biological systems maintain phenotypic stability in the face of diverse perturbations imposed by the environment, stochastic events, and genetic variation. Robustness often arises through positive and negative feedback loops and other forms of control that constrain a gene's output. This feedback insulates the *Correspondence: aderem@systemsbiology.org system from fluctuations imposed on it by the environment. Positive feedback, in general, enhances sensitivity , whereas negative feedback can dampen noise and reject perturbations. Robustness is an inherent property of all biological systems and is strongly favored by evolution. Modularity. A further characteristic of complex systems is their modularity. Multiple useful definitions of a module exist. To an engineer, a module is a functional unit, a collection of parts that interact together to perform a distinct function. Such a module would have distinct inputs, things it is sensitive to, and outputs, things it controls. To a biologist, a module in a network is a set of nodes that have strong interactions and a common function. Modularity can contribute to both robustness of the entire system, by confining damage to separable parts, and to evolution, by simply rewiring modules. Furthermore, modularity decreases the risk of failure of the system by preventing the spread of damage in one part of the network throughout the entire network. Network Modeling by Iterative Refinement To practice systems biology, one must capture and integrate global sets of biological data from as many hierarchical levels of information as possible (see Figure 1). These could include DNA sequences, RNA and protein measurements, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions , biomodules, signaling and gene regulatory networks, cells, organs, individuals, populations, and ecologies. The data is then transferred to a comprehensive database, where it is warehoused and annotated. Human minds are incapable of inferring the emergent properties of a system from thousands of data points, but we have evolved to intelligently interpret an enormous amount of visual information. The data is therefore transferred to visualization programs. This is the initiation point for the formulation of detailed graphical or mathematical models, which are then refined by hypothesis driven , iterative systems perturbations and data integration. In this manner, the phenotypic features of the system are tied directly to the behavior of the protein and gene regulatory networks. Cycles of iteration will result in a more accurate model; ultimately, these models will explain the systems or emergent properties of the biological system of interest. Once the model is sufficiently accurate and detailed, it will allow biologists to accomplish two tasks never before possible: (1) predict the behavior of the system given any perturbation and (2) redesign or perturb the gene regulatory networks to create completely new emergent systems properties. This latter possibility lies at the heart of preventative medicine. Thus, systems biology is hypothesis driven, global, quantitative, iterative, in-tegrative, and dynamic. Some Technical Challenges for Systems Biology • Data quality and standardization. Systems approaches rely heavily on information in the public databases. The datasets are often incomplete, not standardized, or properly annotated; worse yet, the},

   abstract = {The past decades have witnessed an astounding rise of the nascent field of systems biology. By and large unknown and ignored for a long time, the field rapidly moved into the limelight and is now in the process of becoming a widely recognized and respected component of mainstream biology. Of course, much remains to be explored and accomplished in systems biology within its parent domain of biology, but the time seems ripe for expansions beyond this domain. The goal of such an expansion should not be the creation of new strongholds or academic silos outside biology, but the true integration of biological systems thinking into educational programs of other disciplines. The expansion should naturally start with closely related fields like biophysics, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and bioengineering, but should continue further into other areas invested in the study of life, such as medicine, epidemiology, and public health, as well as applied mathematics and computer science. This perspective sketches out how systems biology might be able to enrich the training of a new generation of scientists in these fields of scientific endeavor.},

We found 22,163 such coexpression relationships, each of which has been conserved across evolution. This conservation implies that the coexpression of these gene pairs confers a selective advantage and therefore that these genes are functionally related. Many of these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle, secretion, and protein expression. We experimentally confirmed the predictions implied by some of these links and identified cell proliferation functions for several genes. By assembling these links into a gene-coexpression network, we found several components that were animal-specific as well as interrelationships between newly evolved and ancient modules.},

@article{Goldbeter1991,
   abstract = {A minimal model for the mitotic oscillator is presented. The model, built on recent experimental advances, is based on the cascade of post-translational modification that modulates the activity of cdc2 kinase during the cell cycle. The model pertains to the situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, where the accumulation of cyclin suffices to trigger the onset of mitosis. In the first cycle of the bicyclic cascade model, cyclin promotes the activation of cdc2 kinase through reversible dephosphorylation, and in the second cycle, cdc2 kinase activates a cyclin protease by reversible phosphorylation. That cyclin activates cdc2 kinase while the kinase triggers the degradation of cyclin has suggested that oscillations may originate from such a negative feedback loop [Félix, M. A., Labbé, J. C., Dorée, M., Hunt, T. & Karsenti, E. (1990) Nature (London) 346, 379-382]. This conjecture is corroborated by the model, which indicates that sustained oscillations of the limit cycle type can arise in the cascade, provided that a threshold exists in the activation of cdc2 kinase by cyclin and in the activation of cyclin proteolysis by cdc2 kinase. The analysis shows how mitotic oscillations may readily arise from time lags associated with these thresholds and from the delayed negative feedback provided by cdc2-induced cyclin degradation. A mechanism for the origin of the thresholds is proposed in terms of the phenomenon of zero-order ultrasensitivity previously described for biochemical systems regulated by covalent modification.

@article{Bergman2021,
   abstract = {It has long been hoped that our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes would be helped by the use of mathematical modeling. In 1979 Richard Bergman and Claudio Cobelli worked together to find a “minimal model” based upon experimental data from Bergman’s laboratory. Model was chosen as the simplest representation based upon physiology known at the time. The model itself is two quasi-linear differential equations; one representing insulin kinetics in plasma, and a second representing the effects of insulin and glucose itself on restoration of the glucose after perturbation by intravenous injection. Model would only be sufficient if it included a delay in insulin action; that is, insulin had to enter a remote compartment, which was interstitial fluid (ISF). Insulin suppressed endogenous glucose output (by liver) slowly. Delay proved to be due to initial suppression of lipolysis; resultant lowering of free fatty acids reduced liver glucose output. Modeling also demanded that normalization of glucose after injection included an effect of glucose itself on glucose disposal and endogenous glucose production – these effects were termed “glucose effectiveness.” Insulin sensitivity was calculated from fitting the model to intravenous glucose tolerance test data; the resulting insulin sensitivity index, SI, was validated with the glucose clamp method in human subjects. Model allowed us to examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Relationship was described by a rectangular hyperbola, such that Insulin Secretion x Insulin Sensitivity = Disposition Index (DI). Latter term represents ability of the pancreatic beta-cells to compensate for insulin resistance due to factors such as obesity, pregnancy, or puberty. DI has a genetic basis, and predicts the onset of Type 2 diabetes. An additional factor was clearance of insulin by the liver. Clearance varies significantly among animal or human populations; using the model, clearance was shown to be lower in African Americans than Whites (adults and children), and may be a factor accounting for greater diabetes prevalence in African Americans. The research outlined in the manuscript emphasizes the powerful approach by which hypothesis testing, experimental studies, and mathematical modeling can work together to explain the pathogenesis of metabolic disease.},

   abstract = {Real-world networks are often claimed to be scale free, meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power law k−α, a pattern with broad implications for the structure and dynamics of complex systems. However, the universality of scale-free networks remains controversial. Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free. These findings highlight the structural diversity of real-world networks and the need for new theoretical explanations of these non-scale-free patterns. Real-world networks are often said to be ”scale free”, meaning their degree distribution follows a power law. Broido and Clauset perform statistical tests of this claim using a large and diverse corpus of real-world networks, showing that scale-free structure is far from universal.},

Here, we present a new simulation model in normal humans that describes the physiological events that occur after a meal, by employing the quantitative knowledge that has become available in recent years. Model parameters were set to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model- independent estimates of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in normal. The same strategy is also applied on a smaller database for extending the model to type 2 diabetes. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Metabolomics is an expanding discipline in biology. It is the process of portraying the phenotype of a cell, tissue or species organism using a comprehensive set of metabolites. Therefore, it is of interest to understand complex systems such as metabolomics using a scale-free topology. Genetic networks and the World Wide Web (WWW) are described as networks with complex topology. Several large networks have vertex connectivity that goes beyond a scale-free power-law distribution. It is observed that (a) networks expand constantly by the addition of recent vertices, and (b) recent vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. Scale-free networks are determined with precision using vital features such as a structure, a disease and a patient. This is pertinent to the understanding of complex systems such as metabolomics. Hence, we describe the relevance of scale-free networks in the understanding of metabolomics in this article. Background: Metabolomics is the powerful high throughput technology in light of the whole set of metabolites that provide potential information since it measures and quantifies the outcome of cellular metabolism [1]. A critical challenge for biology and medicine is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the operation of complex cellular systems as a whole since extensive knowledge about the individual components of living cells is insufficient. The dynamic behavior of biological systems is regulated by complex network of interactions between individual components [2].},
